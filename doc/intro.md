Planck is a stand-alone ClojureScript REPL for macOS and Linux.

Planck launches instantly, providing a full-featured REPL environment that is great for experimenting with and learning the ClojureScript language.

Planck is also great for creating scripts in ClojureScript, providing an alternative to Bash for automating tasks.


> Planck is not a ClojureScript compilerâ€”it does not emit JavaScript for use with web browsers or other execution environments. For targeting those systems, the ClojureScript [compiler](https://clojurescript.org) along with REPLs like [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) are useful.

> If you are running Windows, Linux, or macOS, also be sure to check out [Lumo](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo), a stand-alone ClojureScript REPL based on Node.js and V8 that is capable of using NPM libraries.
