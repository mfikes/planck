# Building 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mfikes/planck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mfikes/planck)

## Prerequisites 

See [Building Wiki](https://github.com/mfikes/planck/wiki/Building) for setting up OS-specific build tooling and dependencies.

Pre-made build environments for various environments are available in [build-envs](https://github.com/mfikes/planck/tree/master/build-envs).

## Compiling

```
$ script/build
```

The resulting binary will be `planck-c/build/planck`.

### Parameterized Builds

Specify `-fast` to quickly build a development version that skips Closure optimization:

```
$ script/build -fast
```

To build against a specific ClojureScript dependency, specify `-Sdeps`, which will be passed through to the underlying [`clojure`](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) command.

```
$ script/build -Sdeps "{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version \"1.9.946\"}}}"
```

## Tests

```
$ script/test
```
